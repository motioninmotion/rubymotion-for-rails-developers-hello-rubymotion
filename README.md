# Homework

For this lesson's homework, look up the documentation for the UIColor class (hint: google "UIColor") and try creating a new color for the square using the `colorWithRed:blue:green:alpha:` method. The color should be RGBA(231, 54, 89, 1.0).

Next try changing the label's color as well by looking up the docs for UILabel. Your hint is that the attribute is **NOT** called `color`.

Finally try changing the position and size of the square, and practice changing things in the REPL.

See you in the next video!
